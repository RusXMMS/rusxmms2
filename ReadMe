Prerequisites
-------------
    The patched XMMS can be compiled without any additional dependency,
    but to get recoding on you will need LibRCC (http://rusxmms.sf.net).
    The LibRCC (Russian Charset Conversion Library) supports several
    ways of encoding autodetection. To get this feature on the LibRCD,
    Enca, db4 libraries should be installed prior to LibRCC compilation.
    
    Starting from version 0.2.0 LibRCC supports language autodetection using
    aspell and language translation using libtranslate (the internet connection
    is required).

    So, to get fully functional system, with multi-language playlist recoding,
    you will need following libraries:
	1. LibRCD (http://rusxmms.sf.net)
	2. Enca
	3. DB4 (Brekley DB)
	4. LibXML2
	5. LibRCC
    To get language auto-detection:
	6. Aspell with dictionaries
    To get language translation:
	7. Libtranslate + Internet Connection

Compilation
-----------
1. Copy RusXMMS into the root of xmms source distribution
    Run 'apply.sh' to get RusXMMS with ID3v2 enabled mpg123 
	* Patches from Gentoo XMMS Distribution is used to provide ID3v2
    Custom: Just apply patches you need 
	* all files from source/*.[ch] should be copied into the 
	libxmms directory
2. Run 'aclocal && automake && autoconf' in the root of XMMS source tree in 
   order to regenerate Makefiles.
3. configure, compile and install as usual

Patches
-------
    xmms-ds-rusxmms:		Base RusXMMS patch (required!)
    xmms-ds-rusxmms-charset:	UTF16/RCC for libxmms/charset.c. 
				* Required by Id3v2 tag editor.
    xmms-ds-playlist:		PlayList Recoding (Save/Load/Display)
				* Recodes file names from playlist files
				* Recodes titles from playlist files
				* Recodes titles from plugins if AutoEngine enabled
    xmms-ds-shade:		Enables font selection for Shade Windows

				displayed correctly in the shade window
    xmms-ds-textbox:		Corrects UTF-8 displaying in xmms 'TextBox'
    
    xmms-ds-mpg123:	Recodes mpg123 titles
	    editor:	Enables editing of ID3 tags (v.1 and v.2)
	      keys:	Enables fast keys 
			Esc, Enter: Cancel, Save and Exit
			Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Right: Navigate tabs
    			Ctrl+PgDn, Ctrl+PgUp: Navigate records
    xmms-ds-vorbis-*:	The same functionalities for vorbis plugin
			( No recoding patch is required )

Extra Patches
-------------
    Some extra functionality, which is not included in default "apply.sh" 
    scripts and could be considered a bad or/and dangerous idea.

    xmms-ds-mpg123-wrongencoding.patch:
	The ID3 v.2 defines 4 types of encodings: Latin1, UTF16, UTF16BE, UTF8.
	Original version of XMMS assumes the tag broken if other encoding is
	specified. This patch, assumes Latin1 for such encodings.

Minimal Configurations:
    xmms-ds-rusxmms + xmms-ds-playlist:
	In the case then the autoengine is available, this solution will
	give completely recoded playlist window. The recoding of plugins
	will work as well.
    xmms-ds-rusxmms + xmms-ds-mpg123(no editor and keys):
	This solution will give completely recoded playlist even if no
	autoengine is available, but playlists are unsupported.

Notes
-----
    * Edited ID3 tags and playlists will be saved in the corresponded
    encodings selected using 'RusXMMS' preference page.
