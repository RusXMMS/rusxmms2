Prerequisites
-------------
    The patched applications can be compiled without additional dependency,
    but to get recoding on you will need LibRCC (http://rusxmms.sf.net).
    The LibRCC (RusXMMS Charset Conversion Library) supports several
    ways of encoding autodetection. This depend on LibRCD, Enca, and DB4 
    libraries which should be installed prior to LibRCC compilation.
    
    Starting from version 0.2.0 LibRCC supports language autodetection using
    aspell and language translation using libtranslate (the internet connection
    is required).

    So, to get fully functional system, with multi-language playlist recoding,
    you will need following libraries:
	1. LibRCD (http://rusxmms.sf.net)
	2. Enca
	3. DB4 (Brekley DB)
	4. LibXML2
	5. LibRCC
    To get language auto-detection:
	6. Aspell with dictionaries
    To get language translation:
	7. Libtranslate + Internet Connection
