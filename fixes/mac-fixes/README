mac is unsupported port for  Monkey Audio Loseless Codec (ape) Acutally, it is
known for lot of problems on 64bit platforms. Here is patch fixing another one.


Some description for future use
===============================
 The problems is actully related to converting pointers to/from int type. 
The portability requires intptr_t to be used for that purposes. However,
in many places 'int' still specified. Therefore, if acutal pointer is 
above int size on AMD64, the crashes occurs.

It looks new/malloc on my Gentoo system in the beginning allocates  memory
in the lower segments and everything goes smoothly. However, after a while
the allocation from higher regions is started. This could be traced by
monitoring the result of 
    mac_info = (PlayerInfo *)g_malloc0(sizeof(PlayerInfo));
    decompress = CreateIAPEDecompress(pUTF16, &nRetVal);
in function 'decompress_init' of mac.cpp (xmms-mac). After few iterations they 
would return high address ptr. Actually, the good method of accelerating 
crashes, is usage of following code (within decompress_init):
    
    rep:
    decompress = CreateIAPEDecompress(pUTF16, &nRetVal);
    if (decompress < (void*)0x7FFFFFFF) {
        void *a=malloc((int)1000*rand());
        delete decompress;
        free(a);
        goto rep;
    }

Few notes on mac
================
MACLib.cpp	- C(stdcall) functions for class construction
APEDecompress	- main working class which widly utilizes
UnBitArray	- classes to work with actual data (many int usages within)
  pIO 		- after a lot of black magick is initialiozed by function 
		call:
		    CAPEDecompress::GetInfo
		which in his order calls:
		    CAPEInfo::GetInfo
