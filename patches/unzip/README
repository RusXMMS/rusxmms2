You can use patch in two modes:
    standard: The unzip will be dynamically linked with librcc (In that case
    some problems with building OpenOffice from sources may arise)
    
    lazy: In this case the librcc will be dynamically loaded (with help of
    dlopen, dlsym) during execution.
    

Usage
=====
1. Apply patches: unzip-*-ds-rusxmms.patch, unzip-ds-unixenc.patch
2. In the root of `unzip` source tree run either `update_shared` for standard
mode or `update_lazy` for lazy mode.


Configuration
=============
 - The patch uses "zip" configuration of RCC. This means settings could be 
 altered using "rcc-gtk2-config zip". 
 - ZIP OEM / ZIP ISO / Output  - encodings are important for patch.


Build
=====
 On Unix, call following command to get list of possible targets:
     make -f unix/Makefile list
 and then just build with:
    make -f unix/Makefile <target>
 for example:
     make -f unix/Makefile linux_noasm
