taglib-*-ds-rusxmms-enforce.patch will prevent applications from 
overloading taglib ID3 v.1 parser/renderer. For instance, kid3
has it's onw recoder and bypasses RusXMMS unless this patch is
applied.

If you want to set unicode ID3v.2 titles, please, set in the
LibRCC configuration (xmms.xml) "id3v2" class to point appropriate 
unicode encoding.

1. Some Info Encoding Handling
1.1 Reading encodings
    - Unicode ID3 v.2 tags are read as defined by ID3V2 tag, no RusXMMS
    is envolved.
    - Latin1 ID3 v.2 and ID3 v.1 tags are read using RusXMMS library.
    The 'id3' and 'id3v2' classes are used corespondingly.
1.2 Writing ID3 v.1 encodings
    - ID3 v.1 tag is written using RusXMMS library. The 'id3' class
    selects output encoding.
1.3 Writting ID3 v.2 encodings
    - ID3 v.2 tag output encodings is selected with help of 'id3v2' class of 
    RusXMMS. 
    - If unicode encoding is set (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE)
    the tag is written using selected encoding (independent of original one).
    - Otherwise, original unicode encodings are kept.
    - If original encoding is also non-unicode, than the tag is stored
    in 'id3v2' class encoding. However, it is really a bad idea! Set an
    unicode encoding.
2. Recomended class settings
    - id3 = CP1251
    - id3v2 = UTF-16
3. Notes
    - TagLib supports UTF-16LE encodings within ID3 v.2 tags (described by
    number 4). The UTF-16LE is not part of standard and probably added for
    compatibility with some nasty Windows applications. RusXMMS will not 
    allow to write tags in UTF-16LE.
