Difference between 'rusxmms' and 'rusxmms-full' patches is following. The full patche besides makefile.machine fixes all
other architecure-oss specific make files. The 'rusxmms' patch does not. However, you could execute following commands
to have all makefiles adjusted.

find . -maxdepth 1 -name "makefile.linux*" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i -e "s/LOCAL_LIBS=-lpthread/LOCAL_LIBS=-lpthread -lrcc/"
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "makefile.machine" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i -e "s/LOCAL_LIBS=-lpthread/LOCAL_LIBS=-lpthread -lrcc/"


Configuration
=============
 - The patch uses "zip" configuration of RCC. This means settings could be 
 altered using "rcc-gtk2-config zip". 
 - ZIP OEM / Output  - encodings are important for patch.
